So I've created this kickstart codeigniter module to kickstart my own projects to minimize development time and effor.
A CMS would have been an overkill with too many features and writing an app from scratch would have been reinventig the wheel.
This is where this module will come in handy.

It has : 
a. basic user registration and login flow. ( uses md5 for storing passwords )
b. pages controller to start off with creating static/dynamic pages. 
c. a very basic css file for common styles. 
d. a nice breakdown of the view into header, content and footer for discreet control.

To set it up:
1. copy it into your web directory.
2. modify application/config/config.php and application/config/database.php with your base_url and database settings respectively.
3. import the sql file to create the user table. user.sql
    There are two users already created : "admin@gmail.com" and "notadmin@gmail.com" both with passwords "admin"

Thats it. 
Kickstart your next codeigniter based web project!!
